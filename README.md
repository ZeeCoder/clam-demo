# Clam Demo Application
[![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/ZeeCoder/clam-demo.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/ZeeCoder/clam-demo)

To see the demo, just clone this repo and visit the web/ folder.

For experimentation, you need to do the following:

- run npm install
- run bower install
- run gulp watch

Now any changes you do should be build under the web/js and css folders.
